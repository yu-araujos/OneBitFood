Hi! This is an app about a food delivery using Ruby on Rails. The project is prepared to use on a frontend project with any framework. 

If you want to filter the result, it's possible to see what restaurants, food types or cities that are available on this fictional app.

It was used the gems 'ransack to filter the items on the object and the gem 'rack-cors' to dealing with the same-origin policy issues in web applications.
